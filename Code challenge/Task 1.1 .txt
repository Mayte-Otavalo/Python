*Task 1.1 Reading and Discussion

• What is the output of this program?

v1 size: 0
v2 size: 4
v3 size: 4

• Why does v1.size() return 0 after the move?

It is set to zero because std::vector transfers the information from v1 to v3. V1 is set to zero because it no longer has a defined value.

• What does std::move do?

std::move is a cast that converts an lvalue (like v1) into an rvalue. The actual moving happens when the moved object is used in a move constructor 
or move assignment op



• Why is v1 still in a valid but unspecified state?

This is a feature of the C++ standard to avoid errors, where v1 can only be used to reassign or delete.
